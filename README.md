# directory_json_mapper
Directory map creator

Alright just download the main.php, and run it in your terminal like this 
```php main.php```

That's it.

This will return you JSON string with files and folders in directory "./", also it has optional key-value to let you know wheter it's folder or a file.

Ah yeah also, make sure ```ls -l``` works on your terminal otherwise main.php may throw errors and not work, otherwise I think it should work.
